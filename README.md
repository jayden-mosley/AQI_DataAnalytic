# AQI_DataAnalytic
A short presentation in Google Colab looking at AQI levels across the globe.

To view the interactive elements of the graphs, and the original project, follow the next link, access should be available for viewing:

AQI_DataAnalytics/Graphs/fig1-9 Will include screenshots of every graph used following a fig1-9 syntax in the project (which is why I would advice viewing the original project online).
